# Web Healer

A little game for the web inspired by healing raids and five man dungeons back in Azeroth. Who remembers Heal Rank 2?

- Play on https://webhealer.0sk.ar

A work in progress and happy to welcome new contributors.

See the /docs folder for more.

## Notes

- Most spells trigger a global cooldown (GCD) of 1.5 seconds. During this time you cannot cast any other spells
- Mana regen is paused for X seconds after a cast completes
- Show combat stats once combat ends: Amount healed, Overhealing, Mana spent

## Development

- `bun run dev` 

### Structure

index.html -> src/main.ts

The game uses the `vroum` (https://gitlab.com/jfalxa/vroum library). Vroum helps organize everything in a structure of `Nodes` and `Tasks` that run on a (Game)`Loop`.

To make it easier to create HTML elements, we use https://github.com/WebReflection/uhtml.
